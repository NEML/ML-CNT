- LS_model_v0.py - Python file for LS model v0.
- LS_model_v1.ipynb - LS model notebook including training and testing modulus only. 
- LS_model_v1.py - Python file for LS model v1.
- Hcol_model_v1.ipynb - Hcol model notebook including training and testing modulus only.
- Hcol_model_v1.py - Python file for Hcol model v1.

### Instruction
- Required software/environment: Visual Studio 2017, Anaconda3, CUDA Toolkit v10.0, cuDNN v7.3.1, tensorflow_gpu_1.12_py37
- Files in the “intermediate_weights” folder are required for using LS_model_v1.
- Use LS_model_v1 and Hcol_model_v1 for testing.
